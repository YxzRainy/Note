# 主系表

构成方式很简单，就是把里面的 be 变成 was/were.
当主语是 **I 或单数**的时候就用 was，当主语是 **you 或复数**的时候用 were，主语和表语都不需要变化。

当然，如果是可数名词作主语或表语，要注意可数名词的问题）

我们把**主语 + be + 表语**这个句型分成了四个更具体详细的小句型。

## 人称代词主格（主语） + was/were + 形容词（表语） + 过去时间状语

- I was thin before.
- You were busy yesterday.
- They were cheap before.

## 名词（主语）+ was/were + 形容词（表语）+ 过去时间状语（before/yesterday）

### 人名或地名作主语的时候

**一个人名或一个地名作主语的时候用 was.**

- Nick was rich before.
- Beijing was clean before.

**多个人名或地名并列作主语，用 were.**

- Rainy and jack were handsome before.
- New York and Tokyo were beautiful before.

### 主语是可数名词的时候

**主语是可数名词单数的时候用 was.**可数名词的单数形式不能单独使用，要考虑加限定词或定冠词。

- His fatehr was busy yesterday.
- This book was expensive before.

**主语是可数名词复数的时候用 were.**

当可数名词复数直接作主语的时候，强调泛指，如果是特指，则需要考虑加定冠词或限定词，否则会不符合生活逻辑。

- His students were busy yesterday.
- Computers were expensive before.

### 不可数名词作主语的时候

**主语是不可数名词的时候，属于单数的概念，用 was.**

当不可数名词直接作主语的时候，强调泛指，如果是特指，则需要考虑加定冠词或限定词，否则会不符合生活逻辑。

- Oil was cheap before.
- Rice was cheap before.
- The water was clean yesterday.

## 人称代词主格（主语） + was/were + 名词（表语）+ 过去时间状语（before/yesterday）

- I was a guide before.
- You were my student before.
- They were dotors before.

## 名词（主语）+ was/were + 名词（表语）+ 过去时间状语

### 人名作主语的时候，一个人名作主语时用 was.

- Nick was a teacher before.

如果是两个并列的人名作主语用 were.

- Nick and Rainy were farmers before.

### 可数名词单数作主语，用 was.

此时要注意可数名词单数不能单独使用，要考虑加限定词或冠词。

- My sister was a worker before.
- Her classmate was a boss before.
- My girlfriend was a my classmate before.

### 可数名词复数作主语，用 were.

可数名词复数直接作主语，强调泛指，如果是特指，需要考虑加限定词或限定词。

- My friends were rich before. 
- These woman were nurses before.
- The building was a library before.

## 主系表句型在一般过去时态中变否定句的规则

在肯定句的 was/were 后面加一个否定词 not 就可以了。was not 和 were not 可以缩写为 wasn't 和 were‘t.

- Nick was a teacher before.
- Nick wasn't a teacher before.
- We were students before.
- We were not studenets before.

## 主系表句型在一般过去时态中变一般疑问句的规则

将肯定句里面的 was/were 移到句首，加问号号就可以了。但是有的时候，要根据实际情况，把主语的人称改变一下，这时候，因为主语的人称改变了，有时候 was/were 也要根据人称而改变不同的格式。

- I was a teacher before.
- Were you a teacehr before?（通常不说 Was I a teacher before，因为一般不会自己问自己，另外这句话因为主语的人称从 I 变成  了 you，所以 be 变成了 Were）
